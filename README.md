# MNIST-digit-classification
*	Implemented a model with convolutional and max pooling layers with ReLU activation with SGD optimiser <br>
*	Evaluated the model with k-fold cross validation with k = 5 as baseline and achieved an accuracy of 98.55% <br>
*	Increased the depth of the model and used Batch Normalisation to increase the accuracy of the model to 99.13% <br>
